# To-do project for The Odin Project

This is a task-tracker website built to maintain lists of tasks. Through building this project I gained several new skills, including:

- Development using webpack for both a dev and production environment.
- Incorporating external npm packages (for the date and color selectors, as well as date formatting).
- Linking DOM elements with stored objects.
- Using a combination of Map and Object data structures to preserve list and task information.
- Conversion of that structure to a stringifiable object using recursion, to be saved and restored across sessions via localStorage.
- Search functionality, to identify tasks based on name as well as if they are flagged, scheduled, or scheduled for today.
- Organisation of functions into reusable modules, enabling more seamless code structure (i.e closing all other forms when a new form is opened).
- Front end design.
- Responsive web design for small screens.

## Features still to be added

- Add location setting to tasks
- Online user storage with Firebase
- Log in with Google/Apple
